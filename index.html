								<h2 class="major">About</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Family.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>First-Generation: As the first in my family to graduate from high school and college, I feel a deep sense of responsibility and gratitude. I feel as though I carry not only my own dreams but also the hopes and aspirations of my grandparents and parents who sacrificed so much for my siblings and I.<p>
								<p>Back in the '80s, my parents immigrated to the United States with nothing but a dream for a better future. It was a tough journey, filled with challenges and hardships. But they never lost hope. They taught us to find a way, even when doors seemed closed. "If you can't find a door, find a window, or make your own path," our father used to say.<p>
								<p>Growing up, we didn't have many luxuries or privileges. But I saw it as an opportunity to focus on what truly mattered. I had fewer distractions, allowing me to push boundaries and strive for success. And I did just that. Despite the odds, I became the first in our family and extended family to graduate from high school and college.This achievement brought immense pride to my family, and it also ignited a fire within the rest of my siblings which led them to pursue their own individual careers. We feel a debt to our grandparents and parents, who worked tirelessly to give us a chance at a better life. We carry their dreams with us, and it fuels our determination to accomplish our own dreams.<p>
								<p>As first-generation Americans, we've learned the value of hard work, perseverance, and the importance of education. We know that success is not handed to us on a silver platter. It's something we have to earn, day by day. And we're ready to take on that challenge.<p>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/Grad.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>In my mind, going to college was never in question. Financially however, my opportunities seemed pretty limited. I am always honest with anyone who asks me if the University of Houston was my dream school. In the beginning, it was actually my backup plan, I wanted to go away and experience college like most of my other classmates. Unfortunately, that was not an option for me, so I stayed close to home in Houston.</p>
								<p>Restrospectively analyzing every small or major decision I made, attending the University of Houston was the single most important. The students who walk the UH halls aren't you typical college students. Those students come from low-income households, they are first generation students and the majority have been working full-time in order to pay for their studies. I was one of them.</p>
								<p>Nonetheless, the University of Houston had different plans for me, as I was awarded a full scholarship to UH as a result of academic merit and financial need. That scholarship and recognition changed my life and it allowed me to complete school with zero debt and much sooner than anticipated. UH also taught me lessons in humility, pride, inclusion, perserverance, and most importantly grit. I found people there that not only looked like me, but they came from similar backgrounds and were working as hard as possible to cross the finish line the only way they knew how.</p>
								<p>The University of Houston helped to build and shape me, and they gave me the gift of a free education for which I will be forever grateful.</p>
